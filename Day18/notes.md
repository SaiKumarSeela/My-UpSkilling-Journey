## Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) with MLflow

As the field of artificial intelligence continues to evolve, the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly important. Traditional evaluation methods often fall short due to the unique characteristics of LLMs, such as the absence of a single ground truth. MLflow provides a robust framework for evaluating these models effectively. This blog will explore how to leverage MLflow for LLM evaluation, highlighting its key features, metrics, and practical implementation.

****Overview of MLflow LLM Evaluation****

MLflow is an open-source platform designed to manage the machine learning lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment. Its LLM evaluation functionality is encapsulated in the `mlflow.evaluate()` API, which simplifies the evaluation process by providing a structured approach to assess model performance across various tasks, such as text summarization, classification, and question answering.

****Key Features of MLflow LLM Evaluation****

- **Versatile Model Support**: MLflow can evaluate different types of models, including `mlflow.pyfunc` models, registered model URIs, or any Python callable that represents an LLM.

- **Customizable Metrics**: Users can implement custom scoring metrics tailored to specific evaluation needs, alongside predefined metrics for common tasks.

- **Integrated Results View**: Evaluation results can be easily visualized in the MLflow UI, providing a comprehensive overview of model performance.

- **Comparative Analysis**: MLflow allows for the comparison of different models, prompts, and providers, enabling users to make informed decisions based on empirical data.

****Evaluation Metrics****

MLflow supports a variety of metrics for LLM evaluation, which can be categorized into two main types:

- **SaaS Model Metrics**: These metrics rely on external models (e.g., OpenAI) to score the outputs generated by the LLM. They require sending prompts to the SaaS model and extracting scores based on predefined criteria.

- **Function-Based Metrics**: These are traditional metrics that compute scores for each data record based on specific functions, such as Rouge or Flesch-Kincaid readability scores.

Users can select metrics based on the type of task they are evaluating. For example, when evaluating a question-answering model, metrics like exact match and F1 score might be relevant, while for text summarization, Rouge scores would be more appropriate.

****Implementation Steps****

To evaluate an LLM using MLflow, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Model**: Ensure your model is in one of the supported formats (e.g., `mlflow.pyfunc` model, a Python callable, or a registered model URI).

2. **Set Up Evaluation Data**: Prepare your evaluation dataset, which can be in the form of a Pandas DataFrame, a list, or a NumPy array.

3. **Select Metrics**: Choose the metrics you want to use for evaluation. You can either use default metrics for predefined tasks or define custom metrics.

4. **Run Evaluation**: Utilize the `mlflow.evaluate()` function to run the evaluation. Here's a basic example:

   ```python
   import mlflow

   with mlflow.start_run() as run:
       results = mlflow.evaluate(
           model=your_model,
           eval_data=your_eval_data,
           targets="ground_truth",
           model_type="question-answering"
       )
       print(f"Evaluation Results: {results.metrics}")
   ```

5. **Analyze Results**: Review the aggregated results and per-row evaluation metrics to gain insights into model performance.
