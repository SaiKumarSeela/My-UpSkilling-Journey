# Today Learning Resources - Day 12

## **Amazon Bedrock Overview**

Amazon Bedrock is a service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) designed to facilitate the development and deployment of generative AI applications. It grants developers access to a variety of **foundation models**â€”large AI models trained on extensive datasets capable of performing diverse tasks. These foundation models act as the backbone for creating innovative AI applications.

For detailed pricing information, please refer to the [Amazon Bedrock Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/) page.

### **Configuring the JupyterLab Environment**

1. Select the instance type: **ml.m5.2xlarge**.
2. Allocate storage: **10 GB**.
3. Click on **Run Space** to create your space.
4. Open JupyterLab and select **Python**.

### **Running Your Code**

To verify the deployment of your model, run the code available at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SaiKumarSeela/GenAI_on_AWSCloud/tree/main/AWSSagemaker).

### **Testing the Model Deployment**

To check if your model is deployed:

1. Go to **Studio**.
2. Click on **Deployments**.
3. Select **Endpoints** and choose your endpoint.
